# Fraud-Detection-with-Machine-Learning-Algorithms
In this project, I've explored the realm of fraud detection using various machine learning algorithms and employed a dataset from Kaggle to shed 
light on their effectiveness. The algorithms I experimented with include K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Classifier (SVC), Decision Tree, 
Random Forest, Naive Bayes, and Logistic Regression.

After conducting a comprehensive analysis, the results revealed that the Random Forest algorithm outperformed the others, 
demonstrating its robustness and capability in detecting fraudulent activities. The project not only showcases the implementation 
of these algorithms but also offers insights into their comparative performance, making it a valuable resource for anyone interested in 
fraud detection using machine learning.

Key Highlights:

Utilized popular machine learning algorithms for fraud detection.
Leveraged a Kaggle dataset to perform the analysis.
Compared the performance of KNN, SVC, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Naive Bayes, and Logistic Regression.
Identified Random Forest as the most effective algorithm for fraud detection.
